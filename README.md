# Computer Organization And Architecture
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Computer Organization And Architecture. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. 4 bit adder
2. 8 bit adder
3. Basic ALU Operations
4. FIFO
5. LRU
6. Memory Mapping Techniques
7. Signed Multiplication using Booth's Algorithm
8. Unsigned Multiplication
